I received dozens of pull requests when my [count-words article](https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/) first came out, almost to the point where I couldn't keep up with them. Thanks for all the submissions!

However, I'm **not taking new submissions anymore,** due mainly to the amount of time I've spent on this already. The major languages are there, and many minor ones. However, I'm still open to receiving feedback -- you can either email me (via the email address on my website) or open an issue here. Thanks!
